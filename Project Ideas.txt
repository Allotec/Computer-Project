Ideas
Arduino Computer Project
    Opens to terminal with commands
    Code editor for new programs or from EEPROM
        
    Use 4 EEPROM's and turn it into a serial interface 
    It will take in assembly and turn it into the MIPS machine code if a txt file then store as ASCII
    With that make a file manager with file names and you can read and load
    to implement MIPS instruction set (32 bit)
    Use the SRAM to store the values in the char array so it only has to be 4 rows and can fetch from SRAM when you scroll

    Make a C to MIPS compiler
    Make a circuit emulator with debugging tools like MARS in circuit

    Actual USES/Motivation
        Making it a standalone computer
