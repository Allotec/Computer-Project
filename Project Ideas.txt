Ideas
Arduino Computer Project
    Opens to terminal with commands
    Code editor for new programs or from EEPROM
    
    It will take in assembly and turn it into the MIPS machine code, if a txt file then store as ASCII
    
    With that make a file manager with file names and you can read and load
    to implement MIPS instruction set (32 bit)
    Use the SRAM to store the values in the char array so it only has to be 4 rows and can fetch from SRAM when you scroll

    Make a circuit emulator with debugging tools like MARS in circuit

    Actual USES/Motivation
        Making it a standalone computer

Things to do
    Make sure the memory is realiable by adding checks in any form
    Make the CPU be able to execute mips instructions from the 32 bit machine code.
    Once the CPU is working add debugging features like showing registers and the stack and global pointers and add single stepping while showing instructions.
    Change the menu format into a command line interface
    Make a file structure and be able to create files and execute and store them
